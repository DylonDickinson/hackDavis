# Schedule Heat Map
**WELCOME TO THE APPLICATION**

**Required Modules**
- folium
- I think that's it. Try to run it and see what it says.

**Use**
  
Be sure to change to appropriate directory in main.py. There are 3 locations near the top and one near the bottom

+ Open DavisHeatMap.html
+ Select a time
+ Be sure to save file in same directory as in main.py
+ You can run main.py before saving the file, it will wait until the file exists
+ The input file deletes itself before the program terminates
+ It may or may not automatically open a tab showing the heatmap. Works on Linux. Did not open automatically on Mac, but the file is still correct.
